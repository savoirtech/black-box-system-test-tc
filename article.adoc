=== What's the Opposite of TL;DR?

image::./assets/3rdparty/pexels-tima-miroshnichenko-10625976.jpg[]

There is a good amount of boiler-plate to get started with Test Containers,
and some gotchas.

Here we cover the basics, provide an example, and discuss the basics of the example
which can be used as a template for your own projects.

Note that this article specifically covers the use of `Test Containers` and
not the use of the alternative with `docker-maven-plugin`
(See the article link:https://github.com/savoirtech/black-box-system-test-dmp[SIT - Getting Started with the Docker Maven Plugin] for that approach).
The main advantages of Test Containers over the plugin include:

* Programmable Container Setup - containers can be tweaked and inspected through Java code using APIs provided by Test Containers,
  including inspecting running containers, and running commands inside those running containers during test startup.
** For example, Kafka servers must be properly configured to advertise their addresses to clients,
   which causes problems with docker and ephemeral ports since host mapped port numbers are not known until the container starts.
   The kafka test container works around this problem using Java code that executes a `kafka-configs` command to update Kafka,
   after it has already started, with `advertised.listeners` that includes both (a) the container-to-container network host + port,
   and (b) the host-mapped port and hostname that can be used from the host to reach Kafka running inside the container.
   Note that this problem is challenging to solve when using the `docker-maven-plugin` and is solved automatically by using
   the reusable `KafkaContainer` implementation included with Test Containers.
   (Feel free to open start a discussion on this topic if you are interested in more details.)
* Container Cleanup - Test Containers use an extra container, named with prefix `testcontainers-ryuk-`,
  that watches for shutdown conditions and automatically removes the test containers when needed.
  This is great for Maven builds that are interrupted.

*NOTE* a notable disadvantage of Test Containers is a lack of alignment/parity with
the Maven lifecycle.
Care must be taken to avoid spinning up and shutting down containers repeatedly
as this leads to significant overhead
that can lead to, or at least contribute to,
builds that take many hours to run instead of (ideally, a small number of) minutes.


=== Multi-Module Project Structure

While it is possible to use the `Test Containers` in a single-module project,
doing so makes the POM harder to read,
and can complicate the flow.
This author is a huge fan of modularity, within reason,
and strongly advocates for the use of a multi-module project here.

The structure of the example project:

* Parent
** Main
** Docker-IT


==== Parent POM

Links together the entire project through Maven modules:

[,xml,linenum]
----
include::./project/pom.xml[tag=parent-modules-decl,indent=0]
----

The parent is also a great place for the following,
although it is not demonstrated in this example project:

* Defining common versions of dependencies to use across the entire project
* Defining common versions, and configuration, for plugins used across the entire project
* Defining common profiles and/or build properties to support build parameters (e.g. skipping tests)


==== Main JAR

The entire demo application is contained in this one JAR file
using the spring-boot-maven-plugin to generate an "executable jar" file.

Included in this example project is a web service with a simple endpoint
that returns a fixed response with the text `Hello`
served at the path `/api/hi`.

To view the code, please see the TL;DR section above for a quick overview,
or view the full code itself under the project folder.
Here are links to the full code of the Main module:

===== Generating the Executable JAR

Below is the section of the `pom.xml` in the Main module
that packages the JAR file into an "executable jar".

[,xml,linenum]
----
include::./project/main/pom.xml[tag=spring-boot-maven-plugin,indent=0]
----

Note the use of the ZIP layout - this enables deployments to easily add
to the executions class path through environment variables or
system properties.
Adding to the classpath enhances support for externalized configuration.
Here's an example using an environment variable to add to the class path:

[,bash]
----
$ LOADER_PATH="/opt/application/config"
$ export LOADER_PATH
$ java -jar ...
----


==== Docker IT

Here are the key parts for the System Tests:

* creation of a test container for the application
* instructions to spin up and shut down test containers
* test code itself
* handling errors reported by the tests

Please see the TL;DR section above for a quick overview of the code,
or view the full code itself under the project folder.
Here are links to the full code of the Main module:

==== Creation of a Test Container for the Application

Applications may or may not require a docker container to be created as a product of the build.
This example excludes a separate image as a product of the build,
and instead creates a test-specific image only.

Here is the *from* definition for the container.
For this example, a simple Java-based container is all we need.

[,xml,linenum,indent=0]
----
include::./project/docker-it/src/test/java/com/savoirtech/blog/systest/it/TestContainerRunnerClassRule.java[tag=application-test-image-build-from]
----

A subtle, but valuable part of the image creation here uses the `maven-dependency-plugin`
to copy the main JAR into the `docker-it` project's target folder.
While it is feasible to directly link to the JAR file in the main sub-module's folder,
there are cases where that is not the right JAR file to use,
or where the JAR file may not be there.
Note that we're talking about an edge-case here, but it can happen
and when it does, it can create significant confusion
due to the wrong version of the project main JAR running in the test.

Using the maven dependency plugin, we ensure that Maven gives us the correct
version of the JAR file based on the way the developer runs the build.
For example, when running a full build from the parent folder,
maven builds the main JAR, attaches it to the build,
and then the dependency plugin picks up
that version of the JAR.
On the other hand, if the developer runs a build from the `docker-it` module
folder itself (not using `-pl` arguments),
then maven will use the version of the main JAR file from the developer's `~/.m2/repository` cache.

There are more combinations and possible outcomes here.
There's even the case of testing against a released version of the main JAR file,
downloaded from Maven Central (or other release repository).
The safe advice for new developers is to always run the full build from the parent folder
while developing and testing your local code.
Please feel free to discuss further on the Github discussion pages for this project.

And here we tell Test Containers
to add our main project JAR file into the docker image under the directory `/app`,
using the dependency extracted by the `maven-dependency-plugin`.

----
include::./project/docker-it/src/test/java/com/savoirtech/blog/systest/it/TestContainerRunnerClassRule.java[tag=application-test-image-assembly]

Notice the use of `this.applicationDependencyDirPath` and `this.projectVersion`.
These object fields are populated here by reading their values from System properties:

[,java,linenum,indent=0]
----
include::./project/docker-it/src/test/java/com/savoirtech/blog/systest/it/TestContainerRunnerClassRule.java[tag=application-test-image-config-read-property]

These system properties are written by the Failsafe plugin here,
after maven replaces the `${...}` expressions with their build values:

----
include::./project/docker-it/pom.xml[tag=application-test-image-config-write-property]

The `.withCommand()` method contains the instructions for starting the application
at container startup time.
Note the command is

[,bash,linenum,indent=0]
----
java -Dloader.path=/app/config -jar /app/black-box-systest-tc-main-${project.version}.jar

----

----


===== HelloIT Test

Placing the test file, `HelloIT`, under the project's `src/main/test` folder,
the Failsafe plugin matches the file based on the naming pattern `**/*IT.java`
and executes the test code within.

All methods marked with the `@Test` annotation are executed by Failsafe.

Note the use of RestAssured for a fairly easy way to build the
client call to our service.

----
include::./project/docker-it/src/test/java/com/savoirtech/blog/systest/it/HelloIT.java[tag=test-hello-endpoint]
----

Note the use of `System.getProperty("application.base-url");` in the test method.
That property is injected by `TestContainerRunnerClassRule` using the following statement:

include::./project/docker-it/src/test/java/com/savoirtech/blog/systest/it/TestContainerRunnerClassRule.java[tag=application-publish-application-base-url]
----

The port lookup paired with the system property enables use of
the dynamically-allocated, ephemeral, port from docker,
which is significant for minimizing environment-specific failures,
such as attempting to build on a machine where the developer has other
applications listening on the same ports.

Here are key parts exposing ports from the test container
and capturing the associated ephemeral port numbers.

include::./project/docker-it/src/test/java/com/savoirtech/blog/systest/it/TestContainerRunnerClassRule.java[tag=application-test-image-port-lookup]
----

The commented-out `.getPortBindings().add("5005:5005")` port binding is a convenience to simplify
the effort needed to debug the application while it is running inside the container.
Uncommenting this line grants access to the applications debug port inside the container
from the host port 5005.
Note that the image is also created with `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` configured
with debugging enabled for the application.
Debugging is possible without using fixed host port 5005
by attaching to the port number returned by the `applicationContainer.getMappedPort(5005)` expression.


===== Handling Errors in the Test

Once integration tests have completed,
it is important to inform Maven of failures.
This is not done automatically,
so we need to configure the plugin to do so.
Here is the boilerplate that goes in the
`executions` section of the `maven-failsafe-plugin`.

[,xml,linenum,indent=0]
----
include::./project/docker-it/pom.xml[tag=failsafe-verify]
----

Without this, after tests fail, Maven will continue the build and ignore the failures.
Adding this section, Maven fails the build when there are test failures
(ignoring possible maven options to explicitly ignore failures).


=== Cleanup after Interrupted Tests

Imagine this - you're running the integration tests and notice a failure,
or remember that you forgot to finish that one thing that will make it all fail.
So you decide not to wait for the tests to complete.

So you hit Ctrl-C and stop the process during the integration-test phase.

As opposed to the approach with the `docker-maven-plugin`,
Test Containers will detect and cleanup the containers,
docker network, and other docker resources we allocated for the test.

If that automatic cleanup fails for any reason,
or you don't want to wait for it to kick in,
then here's what you are left with:

* All of the containers successfully started by Test Containers continue to run
(this includes the `testcontainers-ryuk-` special container that normally handles the cleanup automatically)
* The custom network used for the test remains
* Temporary volumes created via Test Containers remain

Here are docker instructions that you can use to help with cleanup:

[,bash,linenum]
----
$ docker ps
$ docker stop a0b1c2d3
$ docker container rm a0b1c2d3
$ docker network ls
$ docker network rm projname-docker-it-network
$ docker volume ls
$ docker volume rm aa00bb11cc22...
----


=== Try it Out

[,bash,linenum]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/savoirtech/black-box-system-test-tc.git
$ cd black-box-system-test-tc
$ mvn -f project clean install
----


=== Limitations

The entire solution presented here has some notable limitations.
There are ways to address these but they were not included here to keep down the complexity in this article.

* Multiple test scenarios or cases split across multiple `*IT.java` files will create an anti-pattern here,
  spinning up and shutting down the test application for each IT class file.
** The author solves this problem using Cucumber to execute all of the tests using a single IT class file.
** While it may be tempting to allow this clean spin-up of the application on every IT class file,
   over time - as the project grows in size - the overhead of spinning up and shutting down all of the
   containers can easily lead to build times in hours.  Especially once the application starts to use
   external dependencies that need to be spun up and shutdown as well (e.g. database, messaging, etc).

=== Author's Notes

* Initially, the plan was to include 1 external system dependency - such as a DB or JMS system - but due to the
length of the article, it was removed.
* JAX-RS was used in this example
** The main motivation is to avoid "vendor lock-in", and use the wider-reaching standard
** Spring's `@RestController` could just as easily have been used.
** There is additional boilerplate wiring for JAX-RS
* Always using `clean` in `mvn clean install`
** Maven will attempt incremental builds to save time
** There are many cases Maven does not catch, which leads to the incremental build being incorrect
** The amount of confusion and time to resolve these cases just isn't worth the savings *most* of the time
** If there are very slow parts of the build, such as the integration tests described in this article,
skipping them while iterating over the code, and then making sure to run them later - before commit and push -
is effective.
** The `install` target is ideal in most cases because it makes sure that working with a subset of the build -
such as running maven out of a sub-module's folder - gives the developer the expected, latest version of built
in-project dependencies.
** Feel free to use different targets as they suit your needs - just be aware of the potential pitfalls.
